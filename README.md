# Legend of Rubyerion: The Seven Paths

Welcome to the world of Rubyerion. In Legend of Rubyerion, you play as a brave warrior who must battle through a variety of dungeons. This game is a roguelike adventure, where if you lose, that character is forever lost to the depths of the dungeon.

## Starting out

### Create a Character

Every adventurer needs to etch his/her destiny so that songs and tales can be passed down from generation to generation. Provide your champions name, weapon of choice and famous battlecry, which you're known for screaming whilst charging into the fray!

Name: Name of your choosing plus titles, class, whatever!
Melee Weapon: This experience works best if you use a hand-held melee weapon
Battlecry: Something you want your character to scream into battle!

### Load a Character

If your character is lucky enough to have survived previous delves into the dungeon, and still live to tell their tale, they can be found here at the inn, ready for the next adeventure. Characters who have been slain can be visited in the graveyard.

### Explore a Dungeon

There are 7 dungeons to choose from. Each dungeon is ranked on a difficulty scale. Monsters from the easier dungeons will be easier to slay, and thus award less XP. Likewise, a harder dungeon will present a harder challenge for adventurers, but possess the highest amount of rewards and XP.

1. Training Grounds - Difficulty: Very Easy - Level up granted: 0
First time picking up a sword? First time leaving your mom's basement? This is probably your best bet to show off those attack moves you've been practicing with a broomstick in front of the mirror while listening to the 'John Wick' original motion picture soundtrack.

2. The Sewers - Difficulty: Easy - Level up granted: 1
Most heroes will find themselves starting their adventure here in the musty sewers below Rubyerion. Small, vile, bottom-feeder creatures and those git branches you -d will end up here, scavenging for fresh food...

3. Tomb of Malchor - Difficulty: Medicore - Level up granted: 2
Malchor was a mighty code-mage many centuries ago. Some say he failed his code challenge in Mod 3, and was banished to the online program. Since then he has fallen into the dark arts: Coding everything purely in Brainfuck.

                                                             -Malchor, probably.

4. Frozen Ice Cave - Difficulty: Medium - Level up granted: 3
Some say there lives a white bear, so large, he can swallow a man whole. Some say this man-eating bear lives in the frozen ice cave. Some say this ice cave-dwelling man-eating bear may not even exist; he is but a myth. What do we say about this bear?
Be sure to bring a coat and a sharp blade.

## Monsters

All 326 monsters are random encounters in the dungeon. Everytime you start a new run, you will be matched up with 3 monsters based on the difficulty of the dungeon you selected.

All monsters are generated from the D&D 5th Edition API

<!-- # Module One Final Project Guidelines

Congratulations, you're at the end of module one! You've worked crazy hard to get here and have learned a ton.

For your final project, we'll be building a Command Line database application.

## Project Requirements

### Option One - Data Analytics Project

1. Access a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.
2. You should have at minimum three models including one join model. This means you must have a many-to-many relationship.
3. You should seed your database using data that you collect either from a CSV, a website by scraping, or an API.
4. Your models should have methods that answer interesting questions about the data. For example, if you've collected info about movie reviews, what is the most popular movie? What movie has the most reviews?
5. You should provide a CLI to display the return values of your interesting methods.  
6. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for your models and CLI interface.

  **Resource:** [Easy Access APIs](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/easy-access-apis)

### Option Two - Command Line CRUD App

1. Access a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.
2. You should have a minimum of three models.
3. You should build out a CLI to give your user full CRUD ability for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a command line To-Do list. A user should be able to create a new to-do, see all todos, update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories, so that a to-do has many categories and categories have many to-dos.
4. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.

### Brainstorming and Proposing a Project Idea

Projects need to be approved prior to launching into them, so take some time to brainstorm project options that will fulfill the requirements above.  You must have a minimum of four [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) to help explain how a user will interact with your app.  A user story should follow the general structure of `"As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"`. In example, if we were creating an app to randomly choose nearby restaurants on Yelp, we might write:

* As a user, I want to be able to enter my name to retrieve my records
* As a user, I want to enter a location and be given a random nearby restaurant suggestion
* As a user, I should be able to reject a suggestion and not see that restaurant suggestion again
* As a user, I want to be able to save to and retrieve a list of favorite restaurant suggestions

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable.
3. Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
4. Make sure your project checks off each of the above requirements.
5. Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working project.
    * The video should:
      - Have an overview of your project.(2 minutes max)
6. Prepare a presentation to follow your video.(3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      - Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      - Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      - Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      - Present any code you would like to highlight.   
7. *OPTIONAL, BUT RECOMMENDED*: Write a blog post about the project and process.

- How do I turn off my SQL logger?

# in config/environment.rb add this line:
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = nil
